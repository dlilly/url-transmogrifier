## Motivation

URLs are everywhere. We need a way to communicate them more easily. There are a few ways to do this:

* Shorten them
* Make them easier to pronounce

Different use cases - one's better for a poster, one's better when you're telling your friend a URL to use. The URL Transmogrifier has options for both!

## Implementation

First off, hearty thanks to Calvin and Hobbes, whose Transmogrifier was the inspiration for the name of the project!

This is a next.js app, using React for the front end and Node for the back end. Typescript is used throughout the project.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
